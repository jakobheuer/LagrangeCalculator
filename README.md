# LagrangeCalculator by Jakob Heuer (Acronym), 8.9.2020
## What are Lagrange Points?
Lagrange points are positions in space where objects sent there tend to stay put. At Lagrange points, the gravitational pull of two large masses precisely equals the centripetal force required for a small object to move with them. These points in space can be used by spacecraft to reduce fuel consumption needed to remain in position. -https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/resources/754/what-is-a-lagrange-point/
